Designed and executed SQL queries to analyze national and state-level population census data, including growth rates, literacy rates, sex ratios, and demographic trends across districts
Designed and executed complex SQL queries to perform in-depth analysis of population census data across India. The queries extracted insights on national and state-level demographic trends, such as population growth rates, literacy rates, sex ratios, and regional variations. Key tasks included calculating total and average growth rates, determining top and bottom-performing states, analyzing literacy and sex ratio distributions, and extracting data for specific states and districts based on conditions. Additionally, joined datasets to compute derived metrics, such as male and female population counts, literacy levels, and historical population changes. Created advanced analyses to evaluate population density, area distribution, and ranked districts by literacy ratio, providing actionable insights for policy-making and reporting.
